#Recidivism Risk Assessments VS Justice
In this document, I discuss two articles about two different viewpoints of Recidivism Risk Assessments and Justice. I summary and discuss two opposing views on this important matter.

## Article 1
In Dasha Pruss's [How Recidivism Risk Assessments Impede Justice](https://points.datasociety.net/how-recidivism-risk-assessments-impact-justice-65c6459243cc) discusses the use of recidivism risk assessment instruments in the criminal justice system, particularly in Pennsylvania. These instruments utilize algorithmic calculations based on demographic factors and past arrest data to estimate the risk of an individual reoffending within three years of release from prison. The article highlights that despite the intent to reduce the prison population and address bias in sentencing, these tools have not achieved their goals in practice.

In summary, the article argues that while risk assessment instruments are promoted as a way to address bias in the criminal justice system, they often face resistance from judges and may not achieve their intended goals. It calls for a focus on practical changes that have a more significant impact on reducing incarceration rates.


## Article 2
Contrary to the claims made in Pruss' piece on the issue, Reason magazine's [Predicting Recidivism: Continuing To Improve the Bureau of Prisonsâ€™ Risk Assessment Tool, PATTERN](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/predicting-recidivism-continuing-improve-bureau-prisons-risk-assessment-tool) , A review of PATTERN 1.3 demonstrates its ability to accurately predict recidivism.

In a word, PATTERN is a risk assessment tool developed as part of the First Step Act to predict recidivism among individuals in federal custody. While it has shown promise, there is ongoing work to address bias and disparities in its predictions, with a commitment to improving its fairness and accuracy.

To make a brief summary, building a crime prediction model from a database is indeed an innovative idea, but it is controversial. Judging from the feedback data in practical applications, the effect is not ideal. At the same time, the establishment of the database also involves citizen information security and privacy. This triggered discussions on effectiveness and safety. Although the two articles contrast in viewpoint, suggestions and ideas for the application of these data are revealed between the lines. In my opinion, this collision of views is very meaningful. But what is more important is to update and improve the construction and application of the database and further observe its role in judicial procedures.
